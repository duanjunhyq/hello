## Introduction

**nf-ncov-voc** is a bioinformatics analysis workflow used for 
performing variant calling on SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify and 
profile mutations in Variants of Concern (VOCs), Variants of 
Interest (VOIs) and Variants under Monitoring (VUMs). This workflow has 
four main stages - **Preprocessing**, **Genomic Analysis (Variant 
Calling)** , **Functional Annotation** and **Surveillance**. 
**nf-ncov-voc** workflow can be used in combination with an interactive 
visualization tool [COVID-MVP](https://github.com/cidgoh/COVID-MVP) 
or as a stand-alone high-throughput analysis tool to produce 
mutation profiles and surveillance reports. 

As an input, **nf-ncov-voc** workflow requires SARS-CoV-2 consensus 
sequences in `FASTA` format and Metadata file in `TSV` format. 
Sequences in pre-processing stage are filtered using Metadata 
variables, quality filtered and assigned lineages. Sequences 
assigned as VOCs, VOIs and VUMs are then mapped to SARS-CoV-2 genome,
variant called and normalized in Genomic Analysis (Variant Calling) 
module. Mutations called are then annotated in several stages 
including flagging the potential contaminated sites, mutation 
annotation, genomic feature annotation, mature peptide annotation 
and finally respective biological functional impact using the 
manually curated effort [Pokay](https://github.com/nodrogluap/pokay).
(lead by Paul Gordon [@nodrogluap](https://github.com/nodrogluap)). 
Finally, in the surveillance module, these functional profiles are 
summarized using functional indicators to highlight key functions 
and mutations responsible for them for e.g. **P618H** role in 
_convalescent plasma escape_.

The workflow is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io)-
[DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html), a workflow 
tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very 
portable manner. It can use `conda`/`Docker`/`Singularity` 
containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

A detailed structure and each module of the workflow is presented 
below in the dataflow diagram 
### nf-ncov-voc Dataflow

### Pre-Processing

This module offers two ways to get lineage information for each 
genome in `FASTA` file and listed respectively in Metadata file 
unless a column `pango_lineage` is already available in which case 
both options can be skipped. First option is to use 
[PANGOLIN](https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin) to assign 
lineages and merge the metadata with pangolin report. This 
step can be skipped by passing `--skip_pangolin`. The second option 
is to map input metadata to [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org) metadata 
file (which can be provided by `--gisaid_metadata` parameter) if the 
genomes are available in GISAID. This option is faster and 
computationally less expensive, though limits to only genomes 
available in GISAID. This option can be skipped by 
using `--skip_mapping`.

### Genomic Analysis
This module currently supports two different modes - "_reference_" & 
"_user_" which can be passed with `--mode reference` or `--mode 
user`. By default, `--mode reference` is activated which allows you 
to build a reference library for each lineage and subsequently each 
variant for comparative analysis. This mode can take `FASTA` file 
with multiple genomes (**recommended** & **default**) or single 
genome with a metadata file that should have one column atleast 
(`pango_lineage`) as minimal metadata 
(see [Workflow Summary](#workflow-summary) for detailed options). 
The workflow has numerous options for several steps. For
example, in `mode --reference` user can use `BWAMEM` using `--bwa`
instead of `MINIMAP2` (*default*) for mapping consensus sequences to 
reference genome. Similarly, `ivar` with parameter `--ivar` for 
variant calling instead of `freebayes` (*default*) option.
The user mode (`--mode user`) is by default active when using 
interactive visualization through 
[COVID-MVP](https://github.com/cidgoh/COVID-MVP) where a user can 
upload `GVF` file for comparative analysis against the reference data. 
Uploaded dataset can be a `FASTA` file or variant called `VCF` file.

### Functional Annotation

In this module, the variant called `VCF` file for each lineage is 
converted into a `GVF` (Genomic Variant Format) file and annotated 
with functional information using 
[Pokay](https://github.com/nodrogluap/pokay). GVF is a variant of 
GFF3 format that is standardized for describing genomic mutations; 
it is used here because it can describe mutations across multiple 
rows, and because the "#attributes" column can store information in 
custom key-value pairs. The key-value pairs added at this stage 
include for each mutation: VOC/VOI status, clade-defining status 
(for reference lineages), and functional annotations parsed using 
[vcf2gvf.py](https://github.com/cidgoh/nf-ncov-voc/blob/master/bin/vcf2gvf.py) 
file written in python.

### Surveillance Reports

Different `GVF` files for the same variant are then collated and 
summarized into a `TSV` file that contains mutation prevalence, 
profile and functional impact. Further `TSV` file is also summarized 
as a more human friendly and impactful surveillance report in a 
`PDF` format. Relevant/important indicators can be specified in the 
[tsv file](https://github.com/cidgoh/nf-ncov-voc/blob/master/assets/ncov_surveillanceIndicators/functions_df_template.tsv). 
This feature of surveillance reports can be used to identify new 
clusters, important mutations, and track their transmission and 
prevalence trends. However, if not required, this step can be 
skipped using `--skip_surveillance`. An example of surveillance file 
for Omicron variant using 
[VirusSeq Data Portal](https://virusseq-dataportal.ca) is available in 
[Docs](https://github.com/cidgoh/nf-ncov-voc/blob/master/docs)

4. Start running your own analysis!

    * Typical command for reference mode when Metadata File don't have 
      lineage information:

        ```bash
        nextflow nf-ncov-voc/main.nf \
            -profile <conda, singularity, docker> \
            --prefix <testing> \
            --mode reference \
            --startdate <2020-01-01> \
            --enddate <2020-01-01> \
            --seq <Sequence File> \
            --meta <Metadata File> \
            --skip_mapping \
            --outdir <Output Dir>
        ```

    * Typical command for reference mode when Metadata File already 
      have 
      lineage information:

        ```bash
        nextflow nf-ncov-voc/main.nf \
            -profile <conda, singularity, docker> \
            --prefix <testing> \
            --mode reference \
            --startdate <2020-01-01> \
            --enddate <2020-01-01> \
            --seq <Sequence File> \
            --meta <Metadata File> \
            --skip_mapping \
            --skip_pangolin \
            --outdir <Output Dir>
        ```
    * An executable Python script called 
   [`functional_annotation.py`](https://github.com/cidgoh/nf-ncov-voc/blob/master/bin/functional_annotation.py)
   has been provided if you would like to update the functional 
      annotations from `POKAY`. This will create a new file which 
      **should replace** the current file in 
   [assets/functional_annotation](https://github.com/cidgoh/nf-ncov-voc/blob/master/assets/ncov_functionalAnnotation).
